This script was coded using PyCharm using Python 3.12. It uses basic libraries such as numpy, math and matplotlib.

Requirements:
Python 3.12 or higher installed on your machine
Numpy, math and matplotlib

If some of these libraries weren't available on your system, try typing:

Numpy: pip install numpy
Math: pip install math
Matplotlib: pip install matplotlib

To execute the code:
Open a terminal on the location of the script and type: python '.\temperature distribution of a sphere.py'
If this doesn't work, try typing: python temp (and press Tab)

To change the different constants:
Open the script on your text editor or IDE of choice and change the values encapsulated in the Parameters section of the
code. Then save the script and rerun it.
